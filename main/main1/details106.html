            <p>LCD (Liquid Crystal Display): Common and energy-efficient.
                LED (Light Emitting Diode): A type of LCD that uses LED backlighting for better brightness and color.
                OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode): Offers superior contrast and vibrant colors but can be more expensive.
                Measured diagonally in inches, common sizes range from 21 inches to 32 inches or larger. Larger screens provide a more immersive experience but require more desk space.
                Full HD (1920x1080): Standard for most monitors.
                QHD (2560x1440): Offers higher pixel density and sharper images.
                4K (3840x2160): Ultra HD, excellent for gaming and content creation.
                5K and above: For professional use with high detail, typically found in specialized monitors.
                Measured in Hertz (Hz), this indicates how many times per second the display refreshes its image.
                60Hz: Minimum for general use.
                120Hz-240Hz: Preferred for gaming for smoother motion.
                Measured in milliseconds (ms), this indicates how quickly pixels change from one color to another. Lower response times (1ms-5ms) are better for gaming to reduce motion blur.
                TN (Twisted Nematic): Fast response times, good for gaming, but poorer color reproduction and viewing angles.
                IPS (In-Plane Switching): Better color accuracy and viewing angles, ideal for graphic design and media consumption.
                VA (Vertical Alignment): Good contrast ratios, decent color reproduction, better for mixed usage.</p>
