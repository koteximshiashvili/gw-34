            <p>Specialized tables designed for playing games, which can include features like felt surfaces for poker or built-in storage for game components. 
                Common shapes include rectangular, square, round, and oval. The shape can affect seating capacity and room layout 
                Tables come in different sizes, influencing how many people can comfortably sit and use them. 
                Varies from modern and minimalist to traditional and ornate, fitting a wide range of interior design preferences. 
                Tables serve a wide range of purposes, from dining and working to gaming and crafting, making them essential in many settings. 
                Many tables come with extendable features to accommodate more guests or can be multi-functional. 
                Be cautious with wet items on the table, as excessive moisture can warp or damage wood and other materials. 
                Use trivets or hot pads under hot dishes to prevent damage to the table surface. 
                Regularly check for scratches, dents, or loose joints. Make repairs as needed to prolong life. 
                Keep tables out of direct sunlight to prevent fading of colors or finishes.</p>
